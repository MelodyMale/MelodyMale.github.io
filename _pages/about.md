Thai backpacker, living in Australia (actually, only in Victoria for now, haha). 

I was a data engineer for 2 years, mainly on developing web API with Python and maintaing pipelines with SQL and Google Cloud Platform.

Trying to beat the Australian job market with the result 100% fail (oh naur)

But that's okay, I got a plan. What about start with Cybersecurity instead?

Sound good, let's get it!!
